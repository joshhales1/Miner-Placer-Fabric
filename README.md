# Miner and Placer Block Fabric Minecraft Mod

- Adds a Miner block which mines and drops whatever is in front of it when it is activated.
- Adds a Placer block which selects a random block from its 9-item inventory and places it on the ground in the direction it is facing.

Just discovering how Java modding works. Hopefully more to come.
